        // Define a function that takes an array of strings, and returns the most commonly occurring string in that array.

        // Pseudocode Steps
        // need to iterate through array and count occurrences of each string
        // need a for loop to iterate through the array 
        // need empty object to store the count occurrences in 


        const cats = ["Tom", "Fluffy", "Tom", "Bella", "Tom", "Tom", "Chloe", "Tom", "Chloe", "Bella", "Bella", "Bella"]

        mostCommon = (array) => {
            let counts = {}; // count occurrences of item here
            let compare = 0; // compare using a stored value
            let mostFrequent; // variable for storing the most frequent item 

            // this loop will run as long as i is less than the length of the array
            for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
                // inside the loop, save the item of the array we are iterating on into the variable 'word'
                const word = array[i]; // ex. could be 'Tom'

                // COUNTING OCCURRENCES OF THE ITEM
                // check if counts object has item whatever value is stored in word
                if (counts[word] === undefined) { // if counts[word] doesn't exist
                    counts[word] = 1; // set counts[word] value to 1 - equivalent of counts.Tom - you are filling the object here
                } else { //if it exists
                    counts[word] = counts[word] + 1 // increment the existing value by 1
                }

                // checking if counts[word] (ex. Tom) is greater than the compare value, which is 0 at the beginning of loop
                if (counts[word] > compare) { // if counts[word] > 0 (first time)
                    compare = counts[word]; // set compare to counts[word] (ex. if counts['Tom'] is 2, then 2 is greater than 0, and 2 will be set as the new value of compare)
                    mostFrequent = word; // set mostFrequent value 
                }
            }
            console.log(mostFrequent);
        }

        mostCommon(cats);
