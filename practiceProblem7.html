        // Array Summation

        // Write a function that takes two integer arrays as inputs. Your function will return TRUE if any two of the numbers in the first array, inputs, add up to any of the numbers in the second array, tests, and FALSE otherwise. 

        // For example,
        // If you were given the arrays inputs: [-1, 8, 3] and tests: [3, 7, 2], you would return TRUE, because -1 + 3 is 2, 2 appears in the tests array, and -1 and 3 appear in the inputs array. The same applies to -1 + 8 = 7, though your function does not need to distinguish multiple matches. 

        // If you were given the arrays inputs: [9, 6, 12] and tests: [1, 2, 3], you would return FALSE: no pair of numbers in the inputs array add up to any of the numbers in the tests array. 

        const input1 = [-1, 8, 3];
        const test1 = [3, 7, 2];

        const input2 = [9, 6, 12];
        const test2 = [1, 2, 3];


        whileArraySum = (inputs, tests) => {
            // while there are at least 2 things to compare 
            while (inputs.length > 1) {
                for (let checkAgainst = 1; checkAgainst < inputs.length; checkAgainst++) {
                    let match = inputs[0] + inputs[checkAgainst];
                    if (tests.includes(match)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                inputs.shift(); // if it doesn't find a match, dumps that first item 
            }
            return false;
        }

        console.log(whileArraySum(input1, test1));
        console.log(whileArraySum(input2, test2));
